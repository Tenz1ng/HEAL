## Project Overview

H.E.A.L. (Health Evaluation by AI Logic) is a personal health companion that tracks your vitals, mood, and meds—then uses an AI health agent to flag concerns early and offer practical self-care tips.

### Core features

- Connect your smartwatch to auto-collect heart rate, sleep, and calories.
- Daily mood journal to spot mental-wellness trends.
- Medication reminders so doses aren’t missed.
- An AI health agent that surfaces patterns, suggests next steps, and summarizes each chat for your long-term log (with consent).

### Why it matters

- Early detection → fewer avoidable escalations.
- Built for busy people who want preventive care and simple, clear guidance.
